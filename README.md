# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
to install pakages
npm i
to run test cases
npx hardhat test
to deploy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

```

```
